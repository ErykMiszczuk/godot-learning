# Godot learning
This is main repo for my reaserch and experiments in Godot. Don't expect documentation or the best code quality, this repo is just for fun pet projects.

### So what's inside

#### Custom resources
I really wanted to explore this particular feature out of curiosity if Godot have some method to store pure data. It turns out that's what custom resources are made for. I think it should be usefull for storing items data in game. I just need to check if it plays well with eg. inheritance or dependency injection.

#### Custom plugin
During my research on Custom resources I came across links pointing to creation of custom plugins. I had some spare time so I decide to test it and make custom button. Of course following tutorial available in official Godot docs (wich is very good BTW).
